# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```

# Solomon's Notes:
This project is for a dynamic on-chain NFT metadata. Warning. This project is currently having an issue on running to the mumbai testnet, requires to debug the wallet account. Will be skipping this project for now and head on to week 4.
